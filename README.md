# pattern
In this program we have to print star in the shape of pyramid.
I have intialized 3 variables i,j,k and row,where,
i for rows and k for columns and j to print start,
row denotes the number of rows you want to print,  
Outer loop work for rows 
,inner loop work for space  
,prints space between two stars    
,inner loop for columns  
 ,prints star    
,throws the cursor in a new line after printing each line
